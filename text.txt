The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall.
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
You may say I am a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday you will join us. And the world will live as one.
It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.
It is only when we take chances that our lives improve.
It is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation.
